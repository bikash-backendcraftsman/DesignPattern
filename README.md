🧠 Overview

The Design Pattern Tracker is a structured, real-world roadmap to master Java Design Patterns and System Design through practical projects.

This repository helps you move from:
	•	Understanding individual patterns →
	•	Combining them into small projects →
	•	Applying them in large-scale architectures (E-commerce, Ride-Sharing, etc.)

Each level includes examples, UMLs, and clean Java implementations.

🧩 Learning Structure

Level                             Focus                                  Description

🟢 Beginner                       Learn patterns individually            Understand intent, structure, and behavior with single-class examples.

🟡 Intermediate                   Combine patterns                       Apply 2–3 patterns together to simulate real systems.

🔵 Advanced                       Real-world system projects             Design scalable systems with multiple pattern interactions.

🧠 Retention Playbook

“Consistency builds memory. Reflection builds understanding.”

	•	🧾 Pattern Diary: Document every pattern — Intent, Fit, Anti-Fit, Trade-offs.
	•	🔁 Spaced Review: Revisit on D2, D7, D21, D60.
	•	🧩 Refactor Friday: Take an old problem (e.g., LeetCode) and refactor using a pattern.
	•	🎥 Teach-Back: Record a short Loom video explaining one pattern per week.
	•	💡 Smell → Pattern Map:
	•	Long if-else → Strategy / State
	•	Many constructors → Builder
	•	Wrapper classes → Decorator
	•	External API mismatch → Adapter
	•	Expensive remote call → Proxy
	•	Cross-cutting validation → Chain of Responsibility

🚀 How to Use This Repository
	1.	Clone the repository
  
    git clone https://github.com/bikash-backendcraftsman/DesignPattern.git

  2.	Import into IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code (Java Extension Pack)
	3.	Explore each pattern folder and read its local README.md
	4.	Run the example classes with the main method to visualize behavior
	5.	Track progress weekly using the linked Design Pattern Tracker Sheet
